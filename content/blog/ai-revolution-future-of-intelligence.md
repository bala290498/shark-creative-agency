## 🔍 What Is AI?

AI, or **Artificial Intelligence**, refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence — such as **reasoning, learning, perception, and language understanding**.  
Most modern AI systems are built using **Machine Learning (ML)** — algorithms that improve automatically through experience — and **Deep Learning (DL)**, which simulates human neural networks.

## ⚖️ The Ethics of Intelligence

As AI becomes more powerful, ethical questions become more urgent:
- **Bias in algorithms:** Are we building fair systems?  
- **Privacy:** How do we protect user data while using AI responsibly?  
- **Job disruption:** Which roles will vanish — and which new ones will emerge?  

Responsible AI development requires transparency, accountability, and fairness at every level.
